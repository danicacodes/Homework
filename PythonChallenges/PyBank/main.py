# The total number of months included in the dataset
# The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
# Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# First we'll import the os module
# This will allow us to create file paths across operating systems
import os

# Module for reading CSV files
import csv

csvpath = os.path.join(".","python-challenge","PythonChallenges","PyBank",'budget_data.csv')

# # Method 1: Plain Reading of CSV files
# with open(csvpath, 'r') as file_handler:
#     lines = file_handler.read()
#     print(lines)
#     print(type(lines))


# Method 2: Improved Reading using CSV module

with open(csvpath, newline='') as csvfile:

    # CSV reader specifies delimiter and variable that holds contents
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')

    csv_header = next(csvreader)
    total = 0
    for row in csv.reader(csvfile):
        total += int(row[1])
    #print(total)
    #print(csvreader)
    # Read the header row first
    #print(f"CSV Header: {csv_header}")
